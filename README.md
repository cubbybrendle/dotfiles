# Dotfiles

Here I keep my configuration files.

## Notes

* These aren't really meant to be forked, but definitely steal from them.
* The setup script symlinks some configuration files and directories. It also generates new files that load/source other files from the repo. This enables basic "plugin" functionality. I maintain other dotfiles for work and personal projects. Sourcing lines can be added to the stubs generated by this main setup script.

## ZSH

I started out using ZSH with [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh), but found startup to be sluggish. The framework does a lot that I don't need. I stripped away almost all of it, leaving just a few sections that were useful. You'll notice MIT License comment blocks in several of the lib files.

## Ruby Console

I have a simple, customized Ruby console, powered by Pry. An executable called `console` is created in ~/bin. It is not run as part of a bundle. It's like vanilla `pry`, but it loads some useful gems and stdlib modules, and defines some helper methods.
