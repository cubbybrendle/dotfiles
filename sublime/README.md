# Sublime Text Settings

1. Install Sublime Text
2. Install Package Control (cmd + shift + p then "Install Package Control")
3. Symlink this directory to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`
4. Restart Sublime. Packages should be installed and all settings should be in effect.

The symlinking happens in the setup script if using that and only if there is nothing in the User directory already.
